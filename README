About

Smartpairs allows you forget about difficult keys combination like vi{ or va".

Now you can use only one shortcut for all typical combinations. Even if you've already 
selected something you can easily fix selection by using smartpairs. 

Plugin searches first unpair symbol from the left of the current cursor
position and then runs target command with this symbol. When you press 
'v' again plugin extend current selection by next pairs.

Installation

Use https://github.com/tpope/vim-pathogen for quick plugin installation. 

If you already have pathogen then put smartpairs into ~/.vim/bundle like this:

    cd ~/.vim/bundle
    git clone https://github.com/gorkunov/smartpairs.vim.git

Mappings

By default smartpairs focuses on selection command but it also supports delete/change/yank.

Commands list:

    vi* -> viv
    va* -> vav
    ci* -> civ
    ca* -> cav
    di* -> div
    da* -> dav
    ya* -> yiv
    ya* -> yav
    Where * is in <, >, ", ', `, (, ), [, ], {, } or t as tag
    
After v* commands you can press v again and selection will be extended to 
the next pairs.

Advanced configuration

For changing smartpairs keys binding add those lines to your .vimrc file:

"Key for running smartpairs in all modes (select/delete/change/yank)
"default is 'v'
let g:smartpairs_key = 'v'

"Key for running smartpairs in the selection mode 
"(extend current selection to the next pair)
"default is 'v'
let g:smartpairs_nextpairs_key = 'v'

"Key for running smartpairs in the selection mode
"for extending selection with IN-mod (like vi")
"default is 'z'
let g:smartpairs_nextpairs_key_i = 'z'

"Key for running smartpairs in the selection mode 
"for extending selection with ABOVE-mod (like va")
"default is 'Z'
let g:smartpairs_nextpairs_key_a = 'Z'

"Smartpairs looks only 20 lines before cursor position
"but you can changes this limit:
let g:smartpairs_maxdepth = 20
```
